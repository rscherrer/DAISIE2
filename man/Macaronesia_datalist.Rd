\description{
A list containing the colonization and branching times of the terrestrial
avifauna in 4 archipelagos: Azores, Canary Islands, Cape Verde and Madeira.
It is an R list object with the 4 main elements corresponding to each of the
archipelagos (e.g. Macaronesia_datalist[[1]] calls the Azores data). Each of
the four elements is then made of several elemants:\cr \cr
The first element of the list for an archipelago has two components: \cr \cr
\code{$island_age} - the island age \cr
\code{$not_present} - the number of
mainland lineages that are not present on the island \cr \cr
The following elements of the list each contains information on a single colonist lineage
on the island and has 5 components:\cr \cr
\code{$colonist_name} - the name
of the species or clade that colonized the island \cr
\code{$branching_times} - island age followed by stem age of the population/species
in the case of Non-endemic, Non-endemic_MaxAge species and Endemic species with no close
relatives on the island. For endemic clades with more than one species on the island
(cladogenetic clades/ radiations) these should be island age followed by the
branching times of the island clade including the stem age of the clade. \cr \cr
* Non_endemic_MaxAge: 1\cr
* Endemic: 2 \cr
* Endemic&Non_Endemic: 3 \cr
* Non_endemic: 4 \cr \cr
* Endemic_MaxAge: 5 \cr \cr
\code{$missing_species} - number of island species that were not sampled for
particular clade (only applicable for endemic clades) \cr
\code{$type1or2} -
whether the colonist belongs to type 1 or type 2. In this dataset all are
equal to 1. \cr
