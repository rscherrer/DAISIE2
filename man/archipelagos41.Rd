\description{
A datalist with 41 items representing the 41 archipelagos.
Each archipelago can be called separately using archipelagos41[[x]] with x being a
number between 1 and 41. Using archipelagos41[[x]][[1]] will show just the
top part of the archipelago item where the archipelago name and physical features
are displayed. The structure of each of the archipelagos is the same as regular DAISIE
datalist generated using DAISIE_dataprep.
