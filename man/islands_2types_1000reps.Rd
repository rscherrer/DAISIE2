\description{
Each simulated dataset is an element of the list, which can be called using
e.g. islands_2types_1000reps[[1]] Each of the island replicates is a list in
itself. The first (e.g. islands_2types_1000reps[[x]][[1]]) element of that
list has the following components: \cr
\code{$island_age} - the island age\cr
\code{$not_present_type1} - the number of mainland lineages of type 1
that are not present on the island \cr
\code{$not_present_type2} - the
number of mainland lineages of type 2 that are not present on the island \cr
\code{$stt_all} - STT table for all species on the island (nI - number of
non-endemic species; nA - number of anagenetic species, nC - number of
cladogenetic species, present - number of independent colonisations present
)\cr
\code{$stt_stt_type1} - STT table for type 1 species on the island (nI
- number of non-endemic species; nA - number of anagenetic species, nC -
number of cladogenetic species, present - number of independent
colonisations present )\cr
\code{$stt_stt_type2} - STT table for type 2
species on the island (nI - number of non-endemic species; nA - number of
anagenetic species, nC - number of cladogenetic species, present - number of
independent colonisations present )\cr
The subsequent elements of the list each contain information on a single
colonist lineage on the island and has 4 components:\cr
\code{$branching_times} - island age and stem age of the population/species
in the case of Non-endemic, Non-endemic_MaxAge and Endemic anagenetic
species. For cladogenetic species these should be island age and branching
times of the radiation including the stem age of the radiation.\cr
\code{$stac} - the status of the colonist \cr
* Non_endemic_MaxAge: 1 \cr
* Endemic: 2 \cr
* Endemic&Non_Endemic: 3 \cr
* Non_endemic: 4 \cr
\code{$missing_species} - number of island species that were not sampled for
particular clade (only applicable for endemic clades) \cr
\code{$type_1or2} - whether the colonist belongs to type 1 or type 2 \cr
