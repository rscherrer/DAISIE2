\description{
Each simulated dataset is an element of the list, which can be called using
e.g. islands_1type_1000reps[[1]] Each of the island replicates is a list in
itself. The first (e.g. islands_1type_1000reps[[x]][[1]]) element of that
list has the following components: \cr
\code{$island_age} - the island age\cr
\code{$not_present} - the number of mainland lineages that are not
present on the island \cr
\code{$stt_all} - STT table for all species on the
island (nI - number of non-endemic species; nA - number of anagenetic
species, nC - number of cladogenetic species, present - number of
independent colonisations present )\cr
The subsequent elements of the list each contain information on a single
colonist lineage on the island and has 3 components:\cr
\code{$branching_times} - island age and stem age of the population/species
in the case of Non-endemic, Non-endemic_MaxAge and Endemic anagenetic
species. For cladogenetic species these should be island age and branching
times of the radiation including the stem age of the radiation.\cr
\code{$stac} - the status of the colonist \cr
* Non_endemic_MaxAge: 1 \cr
* Endemic: 2 \cr
* Endemic&Non_Endemic: 3 \cr
* Non_endemic: 4 \cr
\code{$missing_species} - number of island species that were not sampled for
particular clade (only applicable for endemic clades) \cr
